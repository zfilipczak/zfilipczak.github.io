    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>The mystery black box has a series of tubes and cups.</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>We thought the mystery black box had two sections. The first cup was connected to the funnel and had a tube connected to the second cup. It would only fill to the middle before it would give the rest of the water to the second cup. The second cup had the same function as the first, but it only filled with the remains of the first cup and emptied to the output tube. After replicating what we thought was inside the black box, we poured 320 mL of water and received 0 mL till trial 4 . On trial 4, we poured 400 mL of water and received 400 mL back. We continued pouring 400 mL till trial 7 and received varying amounts of water. Lastly, trial 7 and 8 decreased 20 mL each from the last trial and received varying amounts too. </p>
    <h1>Reasoning 1</h1>
    <p>Models serve as an example of what it is modeling. They help people learn and imagine how the main example functions/looks. I feel that the complexity depends on what the model is modeling or how its made.</p>
    <h1>Reasoning 2</h1> 
    <p>Just like my claim, our evidence showed that the cups will hold an initial amount of water and any excess will go through the tubes, becoming the output amount.</p>
    <h1>Reasoning 3</h1> 
    <p>If there were not a series of tubes and cups in the box, then the data would consist of equal input and outputs.  This would happen because the amount of water would be the exact amount that comes out.</p>
